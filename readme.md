# PHP Snacks

## Snacks 1

Let's create an array containing the basketball games of a hypothetical stage of the calendar. Each match will have a home team and a guest team, points scored by the home team and points scored by the guest team. We print all the games on the screen with this scheme:
Olimpia Milan - Cantù | 55-60

## Snacks 2

With a form, pass name, mail and age as GET parameters and verify (looking for methods that we don't know in the documentation) that name is longer than 3 characters, that mail contains a dot and an at sign and that age is a number. If everything is ok print “Access successful”, otherwise “Access denied”

## Bonuses

Take a fairly long paragraph, containing several sentences. Take the paragraph and divide it into many paragraphs <p>. Each point a new paragraph.
